# Alexa Kings Cup Skill

## Background and Overview
  The development of Alexa skills, and the use of Amazon Web Services is an emerging skill set which many employers seek. In addition to being a desired, and employable skill there is a large lack of quality interactive group games within the Alexa skills shop. A demand exist for quality entertainment with what is becoming a household item.

## Functionality and MVP
  - Users can initiate the skill with a wake word
  - The game will keep track of the cards for each session
  - Rules will be associated with each card
  - At any time users can ask for further clarification for a card rule.
  - Skill will keep track of which players turn it is.
  - Game will be published on the alexa skills marketplace.
  ### Bonus Features
  - Additional games such as
    - Power Hour
    - Dice

## Technologies
  - Node.js
  - JavaScript
  - AWS
  - SSML
  - CSS
  - HTML

## Technological Challenges
  Although an Alexa skill is largely written in JavaScript the entire syntax is very unusual and different. Members of the team will have to familiarize themselves with this new skillset, and become familiar with node.js

  Amazon will host an Alexa skill on their cloud if it set up on Amazon Web Services, which is an unfamiliar program. Although learning amazon web services is the largest value of this project as it is an employable skill.

  Effectively demoing the Alexa skill is going to be a difficult challenge.
